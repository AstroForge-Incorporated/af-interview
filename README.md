# AF Interview

Welcome! If you are reading this, either you've stumbled across this repo, or you are an interview candidate at AstroForge. We do our coding challenge a little differently than some of you are used to. The core of the test is not just the code you write, but your ability to explain what you wrote and why.

There are three paths you can choose for this challenge. Take a look at the interview notification you received from us; that notification may specify a challenge we'd like you to complete.
1. You can write a control loop to control a simple vehicle simulation
2. You can write a protocol for a simple sensor
3. You can write an algorithm to maneuver a robot on a grid with unknown obstacles

You can find each of these challenges in the [`sim`](./sim), [`protocol`](./protocol), and [`grid-robot`](./grid-robot) directories.

To get started, simply fork this repo. Make sure to keep your fork private, and when you are ready add `@rbenefo` as a collaborator.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your contact and ask.
