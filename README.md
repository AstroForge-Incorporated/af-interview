# AF Interview

Welcome! If you are reading this, either you've stumbled across this repo, or you are an interview candidate at AstroForge. We do our coding challenge a little differently than some of you are used to. This is a take-home test, and so feel free to take as long as you want. The core of the test is not just the code you write, but your ability to explain what you wrote and why. You have as long as you want to finish the test, but we have designed these challenges to not be too time-consuming.

There are two paths you can choose for this challenge: 
1. You can write a control loop to control a simple vehicle simulation
2. You can write a protocol for a simple sensor.

You can find each of these challenges in the [`sim`](./sim) and [`protocol`](./protocol) directories. Choose whichever you feel best fits your skills. No extra points are rewarded for doing both, and we will only review one.

To get started simply fork this repo. Make sure to keep your fork private, and when you are ready add `@sphw` as a collaborator.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your contact and ask.
